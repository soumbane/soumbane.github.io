# About Me

<p><div align="justify">Hi! I am Soumyanil Banerjee and I am currently a third year PhD student in the Machine Vision and Pattern Recognition Lab (<a href="http://mvprl.cs.wayne.edu/">MVPRL</a>) of the Department of Computer Science at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA. I perform research at the intersection of Deep Learning and Medical Image Processing domains. I am primarily interested in applications of machine learning, deep learning and computer vision algorithms on medical imaging datasets. Currently, I am working with deep learning and machine learning applications on neuro-imaging data. I develop novel graph representation algorithms to be applied on non-euclidean neuro-imaging datasets obtained from pediatric epilepsy patients. This work is done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.childrensdmc.org/">Children's Hospital of Michigan</a>, Detroit, Michigan, USA.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">Prior to joining my PhD, I worked at <a href="https://www.umassmed.edu/">UMass Medical School</a> where I used image processing and machine learning methods to model the spatially-varying blur functions or point spread functions (PSFs) required for system calibration and iterative image reconstruction in SPECT (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography) systems.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">In my free time I love to travel, enjoy nature and try different cuisines of various countries.</div></p>
