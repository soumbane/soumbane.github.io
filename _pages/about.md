<div align="justify">Hi! I am Soumyanil Banerjee and I am currently a third year PhD student in the Machine Vision and Pattern Recognition Lab (<a href="http://mvprl.cs.wayne.edu/">MVPRL</a>) of the Department of Computer Science at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA. My technical interests include Machine Learning & Deep Learning, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging and Optimization Algorithms. I perform research at the intersection of Deep Learning and Medical Image Processing domains. I am primarily interested in applications of machine learning, deep learning and computer vision algorithms on medical imaging datasets. I have worked with several medical imaging datasets in the past which include X-ray, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), SPECT and Ultrasound.</div>

<div align="justify">Currently, I am working with deep learning and machine learning applications on neuro-imaging data. Specifically, I perform research to develop novel graph representation algorithms to be applied on non-euclidean neuro-imaging datasets. In my current project, the datasets are obtained from diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) scans of the brain of pediatric epilepsy patients. The goal is to predict preoperative language impairment scores that are necessary for pre-surgical evaluation and postoperative seizure outcomes 1 year post surgery using deep graph representation algorithms. These algorithms are also used to identify the Seizure Onset Zones (SOZ's) in the brain which would help the neurosurgeon in performing resective surgery with great precision. The weights obtained from trained deep learning algorithms are used in identifying the regions of the brain that cause the epileptic seizures, by leveraging gradient-based activation maps. This work is done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.childrensdmc.org/">Children's Hospital of Michigan</a>, Detroit, Michigan, USA.</div>

<div align="justify">Prior to joining my PhD, I worked at UMass Medical School where I used image processing and machine learning methods to model the spatially-varying blur functions or point spread functions (PSFs) at pixel level required for system calibration and iterative image reconstruction in SPECT (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography) systems.</div>

<div align="justify">In my free time I love to travel, enjoy nature and try different cuisines of various countries.</div>
