Hi! I am Soumyanil Banerjee and I am currently a third year PhD student in the Machine Vision and Pattern Recognition Lab (<a href="http://mvprl.cs.wayne.edu/">MVPRL</a>), Department of Computer Science at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA. My specialization is in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I currently perform research at the intersection of Deep Learning and Medical Image Processing domains. I enjoy working with medical imaging datasets and application of deep learning algorithms on those datasets. My technical interests include Machine Learning & Deep Learning, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging and Optimization Algorithms. 

In my free time I love to travel and enjoy nature. I love tasting different cuisines of various countries. I also enjoy swimming.
