Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA - Aug 2018 â€“ present
PhD student in Computer Science
Advisor: Dr Ming Dong
Project: Deep Learning on graphs and applications in Medical Imaging.

<div align="justify">Project 1 - I am currently involved in a collaborative project with Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit, MI. 
I am working on application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms on neuro- imaging data. 
In my current project, I apply graph representation learning algorithms on images obtained from 
diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) scans of the brain of pediatric epilepsy patients. The goal of this project
is to predict preoperative language impairment scores for pre-surgical evaluation which is a regression task
and postoperative seizure outcomes 1 year after surgery which is a binary classification task. 
These graph representation algorithms are also used to identify the Seizure Onset Zones (SOZ's) in the brain
which would help the neurosurgeon perform accurate resective surgeries. The stored weights obtained from the
trained deep learning algorithms are used in identifying the regions of the brain that cause the epileptic seizures,
by leveraging gradient-based saliency and class activation maps.</div>
