Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA - Aug 2018 – present<br>
PhD student in Computer Science<br>
Advisor: Dr Ming Dong<br>
Project: Deep Learning on graphs and applications in Medical Imaging.<br>

<div align="justify">Project 1 - I am currently involved in a collaborative project with Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit, MI. 
I am working on application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms on neuro- imaging data. 
In my current project, I apply graph representation learning algorithms on images obtained from 
diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) scans of the brain of pediatric epilepsy patients. The goal of this project
is to predict preoperative language impairment scores for pre-surgical evaluation which is a regression task
and postoperative seizure outcomes 1 year after surgery which is a binary classification task. 
These graph representation algorithms are also used to identify the Seizure Onset Zones (SOZ's) in the brain
which would help the neurosurgeon perform accurate resective surgeries. The stored weights obtained from the
trained deep learning algorithms are used in identifying the regions of the brain that cause the epileptic seizures,
by leveraging gradient-based saliency and class activation maps.</div>

University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA - July 2016 – July 2018<br>
Research Associate, Department of Radiology<br>
Advisor: Dr Michael King<br>
Project: Point Spread Function (PSF) Modeling for SPECT Image Reconstruction.<br>

<div align="justify">I worked with images obtained from Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) systems and developed machine learning
and image processing algorithms to improve image quality by efficient design of Multipinhole (MPH) Collimator in the gamma 
camera in a combined Fan Beam and MPH Collimator SPECT system. The process involves estimation of the spatially-varying blur 
functions or point spread functions (PSFs) at pixel level, for the SPECT MPH system which would be used during system calibration
and image reconstruction. The goal in this process was to store the least number of coefficients for the PSF and calculate most 
of the coefficients on the fly to make the iterative image reconstruction process faster.</div>
